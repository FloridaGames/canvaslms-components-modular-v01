index.html: The main HTML file and entry point for the application.css/style.css: Contains all the styles for the application.js/app.js: The main JavaScript file where the application logic starts.js/utils.js: A module for utility or helper functions that can be reused across the application..gitignore: Specifies which files and folders to ignore in the Git repository.README.md: This file, providing information about the project.Getting StartedClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:cd <project-directory>
Open index.html in your browser. A simple way is to use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's "Live Server") to automatically reload the page on changes.How to ContributeThis project is set up to be developed collaboratively with Gemini. To add a new feature or fix a bug:Describe the change you want to make. Be specific about the functionality. For example, "Create a function in utils.js to format dates and use it in app.js to display the current date."Specify the file you want to modify. For example, "Update the style.css file to add a new button style."I will generate the code for that specific file.You can then copy and paste the code into the corresponding file in your local project.Commit the changes to your GitHub repository.This step-by-step process allows us to focus on one part of the application at a time, ensuring clean, manageable code.
